<h1 style="color:blue;background-color:yellow">Branches of Petrology</h1>


<p style="color:blue;font-size:140%;">There are three main branches of petrology, namely: igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic.</p>
<h2>Igneous Petrology</h2>
<p style="color:blue;font-size:140%;">
Igneous petrology is a branch that specializes in the scientific study of igneous rocks, their chemical composition and texture. Igneous rocks are rocks formed when magma or molten rock is crystallized to form granite or basalt. Igneous rocks may be formed through crystallization or may involve a different process that cools or solidifies the molten rock. Igneous rocks that are formed beneath the earth’s surface form ‘intrusive’ rocks, also known as plutonic rocks. Rocks found on the earth’s surface produce extrusive rocks. About 95 percent of the earth’s crust is made up of igneous rocks. However, these rocks do not readily appear on the surface because they are covered by a thin extensive layer of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.
</p>
<h2>Sedimentary Petrology</h2>
<p style="color:blue;font-size:140%;">This category focuses on the study of sedimentary rocks with an emphasis on texture and composition. Sedimentary rocks include shale, limestone, and sandstone. They are formed when particles derived from other rocks are bound together to form a matrix. These pieces of rock particles together with deposits of chemical and biological properties coalesce to produce a fine rock material. </p>

<h2>Metamorphic Petrology</h2>
<p style="color:blue;font-size:140%;">Metamorphic petrology involves the study of the composition and texture of metamorphic rocks. Such rocks include marble, gneiss, slate, and schist. Initially, sedimentary or igneous rocks undergo mineralogical, textural and chemical changes because of extreme pressure or temperature, and in some cases due to both. Due to high pressure and temperatures, the igneous or sedimentary rocks are transformed into metamorphic rocks.</p>

<h2>Web Mapping By Using Google Maps</h2>
<p style="color:blue;font-size:140%;">
Google Maps is a web mapping service (WMS)
developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Maps"><b>GOOGLE</b></a>

It offers varied types of
data which may include satellite imageries with a
very high spatial resolution (cms to few meters),
street maps, panoramic views of streets, google
traffic, route planning for travelling by different
means(car, bikes or feet) and public
transportation
</p>

<p style="color:blue;font-size:140%;">
It easy to create a web map by using Google maps
